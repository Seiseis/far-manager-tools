Why this project exists
Far Manager is a capable console file manager that shines when you extend it. This project focuses on three core ideas:

- Extensibility through plugins: add new features without modifying the core.
- Scripting for automation: automate repetitive tasks, batch operations, and complex workflows.
- Consistent, fast UX: preserve FAR’s speed and keyboard-centric workflow while offering more power.

The goal is to give users a solid toolkit that integrates with the existing FAR environment. The tooling here is designed to be approachable for new users and powerful for advanced users who want to script and customize their file management routines.

Quick start
Here is a straightforward path to try Far Manager Tools on a fresh setup. If you already use FAR Manager, you can skip to the sections below for deeper customization and advanced usage.

- Prerequisites
  - Ensure FAR Manager is installed on your system. The tools in this project are designed to augment FAR Manager, not replace it.
  - You will need a copy of Windows (classic desktop or compatible environment) if you plan to use the Windows-specific installer. Some components can be used in cross-platform workflows if you adapt them to your environment.

- Accessing the release assets
  - The release page contains the official builds and plugin bundles. To download, go to the releases page and grab the asset that matches your platform and needs.
  - The authoritative download source is the Releases page: https://github.com/Seiseis/far-manager-tools/releases

- Installation and execution
  - From the Releases page, download the asset file and run it to install or initialize the extension set. The exact file name depends on the release, but look for a Windows executable or a bundled package that includes the core plugin manager.
  - If you are unsure which asset to use, choose the latest stable release and follow the in-page instructions. The installer will guide you through setup and integration with FAR Manager.
  - After installation, launch FAR Manager and verify that the new plugins or scripting modules are loaded. The first-time setup may require you to grant permissions or configure a few basic options.

- Basic verification
  - Open FAR Manager and navigate to a sample directory.
  - Invoke a command introduced by the plugin to confirm that the integration works.
  - If you see new menus, commands, or panels, you are likely in the right track.

- First script and a quick test
  - Create a small script that lists files, filters by extension, and logs results to a file.
  - Execute the script through the integrated scripting engine. If the log file appears with expected content, your setup is functioning.

- Next steps
  - Explore a few sample plugins to understand how to write your own.
  - Review the scripting API to see how to access FAR’s events and data.
  - Start with simple tasks to build confidence before moving to more complex automation.

How this project works
At a high level, Far Manager Tools exposes hooks, scripting capabilities, and a plugin framework that plugs into the core FAR Manager flow. Users can extend the editor, add new views, automate repetitive tasks, and tailor the user interface to their preferences.

- Plugin model
  - Plugins register themselves with the host, providing entry points for actions, panels, and commands.
  - Plugins can contribute new commands, shortcuts, and context menus.
  - The framework handles loading, initialization, and lifecycle events, so plugins can be loaded and unloaded without restarting FAR Manager in many cases.

- Scripting layer
  - The scripting layer enables users to write scripts that respond to events, manipulate files and folders, and interact with the FAR environment.
  - Scripts can be used to automate tasks such as batch renaming, bulk copying, or custom file filtering.
  - The scripting engine is designed to be safe and predictable, with clear error reporting and logging.

- Configuration and preferences
  - The system stores user preferences for plugins, scripts, and UI tweaks.
  - You can customize key bindings, panels, color themes, and command visibility.
  - A centralized settings file ensures repeatable configurations across machines.

- Safety and security
  - Scripts and plugins run in a controlled environment. You should review code before executing unfamiliar assets.
  - The project emphasizes safe defaults and a clear error reporting path in case something goes wrong.

Architecture and design
The architecture is modular. Core components handle host integration, plugin loading, and event dispatch. Extensions are isolated to prevent cascading failures.

- Core host interface
  - The host interface exposes events that plugins can react to, such as file selection changes, directory changes, and user actions.
  - Plugins receive a stable API surface that remains consistent across minor updates.

- Plugin lifecycle
  - Plugins go through a simple lifecycle: discovery, load, initialize, run, and unload.
  - During unload, resources are cleaned up to avoid leaks.

- Scripting runtime
  - The scripting runtime is sandboxed for safety.
  - Scripts can be loaded from a user directory or embedded in plugins for distribution.

- Data model
  - The internal data model represents files, directories, and metadata in a straightforward way.
  - Plugins can access and modify this model as needed to present results to the user or drive automation.

Plugins and extensions
Plugins are the primary way to extend Far Manager Tools. They can add commands, panels, and views. They can also implement new behaviors or UI elements.

- Writing a plugin
  - Start with a minimal plugin that registers a command.
  - Expand to add a new panel or context menu option.
  - Include help text and keyboard shortcuts for discoverability.

- Example plugin patterns
  - A command that lists all files matching a pattern in the current directory.
  - A panel that shows batch results and allows quick navigation.
  - A context menu item that performs an action on selected files.

- Packaging and distribution
  - Plugins are packaged with clear metadata, including version, author, and dependencies.
  - Distribution should be straightforward, with install scripts or manual installation steps documented.

- Debugging plugins
  - Use logging to trace plugin actions.
  - Validate that event handlers are receiving the expected events.
  - Check that resources are released when the plugin unloads.

Scripting capabilities
Scripting is a core strength of Far Manager Tools. It enables automation, customization, and rapid prototyping of workflows.

- Supported scripting paradigms
  - A lightweight scripting language integrated into FAR Manager Tools.
  - Access to file system operations, metadata, and UI elements.
  - Event-driven programming using host events.

- Sample scripts
  - A script to batch rename files by a given rule.
  - A script to generate a report of large files in a directory.
  - A script to export a directory tree to a structured JSON file.

- Best practices
  - Keep scripts small and focused on a single task.
  - Add error handling and logging to simplify debugging.
  - Document inputs, outputs, and side effects.

- Performance considerations
  - Scripts should avoid long blocking operations on the main UI thread.
  - Use asynchronous patterns where possible.
  - Batch operations and chunk processing can help keep the UI responsive.

Configuration and customization
Fine-tune your setup to fit your workflow.

- Keyboard shortcuts
  - Assign custom shortcuts to new plugin commands.
  - Use distinct combos to avoid conflicts with existing FAR bindings.

- Panels and views
  - Add panels for quick access to common tasks.
  - Configure panel layout to match your preferences.

- Themes and colors
  - Tailor color schemes for readability and comfort.
  - Persist theme settings across sessions or machine deployments.

- Startup and lifecycle
  - Decide which plugins load on startup.
  - Save and restore session states to resume work quickly.
